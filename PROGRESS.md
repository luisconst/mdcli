# Progress

## 2026-01-24

### Task 1.1: Add Playwright dependency [DONE]

- Added `playwright@1.58.0` to dependencies via `bun add playwright`
- Verification: `bun run typecheck` passes
- Note: `bun run knip` correctly flags playwright as unused - this is expected until Task 1.2 creates `browser-session.ts` which will import it

### Task 1.2: Create browser-session.ts scaffold [DONE]

- Created `src/lib/browser-session.ts` with:
  - `BrowserSessionOptions` interface (browser: 'chrome' | 'firefox', timeout?: number)
  - `extractSessionFromBrowser()` function scaffold returning `Promise<AuthConfig>`
- Verification: `bun run typecheck` passes, `bun run lint` passes
- Note: `bun run knip` flags `browser-session.ts` and `playwright` as unused - this is expected until Task 4.2 integrates the module into auth.ts

### Task 2.1: Implement Chrome profile path detection [DONE]

- Added `getChromeProfilePath()` function to `src/lib/browser-session.ts`:
  - Platform-specific paths for macOS, Windows, and Linux
  - Validates path exists with `existsSync()`
  - Throws descriptive error if Chrome not found (suggests `--session firefox` or `--browser`)
  - Throws error for unsupported platforms
- Verification: `bun run typecheck` passes, `bun run lint` passes
- Note: `bun run knip` still flags `browser-session.ts` and `playwright` as unused - expected until Task 4.2

**Next task**: Task 2.2 - Implement Firefox profile path detection
